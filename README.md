### Tic-Tac-Toe AI Game

This code implements a Tic-Tac-Toe game with two players, one human and one computer. The human player makes their moves by entering a number between 1 and 9 corresponding to the position on the board they want to mark. The computer player uses the minimax algorithm to determine the best move to make.

### What is the Min-Max Algorithm?

The minimax algorithm is a decision-making algorithm commonly used in two-player games like Tic-Tac-Toe. It works by recursively exploring all possible future moves and outcomes of the game, and assigning a score to each possible state. The computer then chooses the move that leads to the state with the highest score for itself (minimizing the score for the opponent).
